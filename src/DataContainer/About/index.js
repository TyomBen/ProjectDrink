      <p className="about">
        The origins of the word "cocktail" have been debated (see section ยง
        Etymology). The first written mention of "cocktail" as a beverage
        appeared in The Farmers Cabinet, 1803 in the United States. The first
        definition of a cocktail as an alcoholic beverage appeared three years
        later in The Balance and Columbian Repository (Hudson, New York) May 13,
        1806. Traditionally, cocktail ingredients included spirits, sugar, water
        and bitters, however, this definition evolved throughout the 1800s, to
        include the addition of a liqueur. In 1862 Jerry Thomas published a
        bartender's: guide called How to Mix Drinks; or, The Bon Vivant's
        Companion which included 10 cocktail recipes using bitters to
        differentiate from other drinks such as punches and cobblers. Cocktails
        continued to evolve and gain popularity throughout the 1900s, with the
        term eventually expanding to cover all mixed drinks. In 1917 the term
        "cocktail party" was coined by Mrs. Julius S. Walsh Jr. of St. Louis,
        Missouri. With wine and beer being less available during the Prohibition
        in the United States (1920-1933), liquor-based cocktails became more
        popular due to accessibility, followed by a decline in popularity during
        the late 1960s. The early to mid-2000s saw the rise of cocktail culture
        through the style of mixology which mixes traditional cocktails and
        other novel ingredients. In the modern world and the Information Age,
        cocktail recipes are widely shared online on websites. Cocktails and
        restaurants that serve them are frequently covered and reviewed in
        tourism magazines and guides. Some cocktails, such as the Mojito,
        Manhattan, and Martini have become staples in both restaurants and pop
        culture phenomena.
